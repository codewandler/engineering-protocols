# Story: <name>

## Outcome

*What is true for whom once this has shipped, in one sentence. If it names a component rather than a
person, it is a task — say what changes for someone.*

## Context

*Why this is worth doing now, and what it depends on. Link the epic or specification it comes from
rather than restating it; the `derived_from` relation already carries the edge.*

## Acceptance

*The conditions under which this is done, each one something a person or a check can observe. "Works
correctly" is not one of them.*

## Out of Scope

*What a reasonable reader would expect to be included and is not — the boundary that stops this
story quietly becoming an epic.*

## Open Questions

*What is still undecided, each with who decides it. A story carrying an unowned question is a story
that stalls without anybody noticing.*
