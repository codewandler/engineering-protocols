# Changelog

Notable changes to `engineering-protocols`. Format: [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/);
versioning follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html), where a **major**
version is a breaking change to a protocol's semantics, not merely to a Rust API.

Entries record what changed for someone using the protocol. Rationale that does not fit in a line
belongs in the commit message or in `docs/design/`.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **The execution core.** `aep-engine` resolves a task against a document tree and answers what is
  owed, what may be done, which transitions are permitted and whether the task is complete:
  - `registry` — the documents in force, with the cross-document checks (unknown references, pinned
    version mismatches, undeclared capabilities and evidence kinds, evidence no verifier can
    establish);
  - `load` — reads a document tree, reporting every bad file with its path rather than the first;
  - `resolve` — task + registry → execution plan: `extends` chains merged, principles filtered by
    applicability, capabilities composed with the document responsible recorded for each entry,
    obligations collected, and the whole configuration checked for rules that could never fire;
  - `execution` — live state with derived facts (`evidence.first_seq.*`, `test.first_result`,
    `evidence.missing`) and a serialisable snapshot;
  - `evaluate`, `policy`, `explain` — what is owed, capability decisions naming the rule that
    decided, and the `✓ / ✗ / ?` completion checklist;
  - `engine` — the `ProtocolEngine` trait, deterministic transitions, an injected `Clock`.
- **The documents.** 42 of them: `aep/1` plus `adp/1` and `aop/1`; 21 principles across intent,
  construction, verification and governance; 4 workflows (development, incident, progressive release,
  forward-only migration); 5 profiles; 5 artifact lifecycles; artifact kind and relation definitions;
  8 templates.
- **`protocol` CLI** — `validate`, `resolve`, `inspect`, `evaluate`, `explain`, `schema`, with
  `--format text|yaml|json`.
- **Worked example** (`examples/development-passkeys/`) — a task, its artifact graph and a five-step
  evidence sequence that walks to completion, replayed by the integration tests.
- **Protocol approval floor.** A protocol may declare capabilities no profile can grant outright;
  `aep/1` declares `production.write` and `deployment.create:production`. A profile that grants one
  fails to resolve.
- **`Action::ProductionMutate`** — production changes that are not deployments now have an action, so
  a policy naming only deployments cannot let them through.
- **CI** — GitHub Actions mirroring `task check`, with schema drift as its own job.

### Fixed

- `evidence.missing` counted evidence required by conditional rules that did not apply, so a task
  could show every requirement met and still be unable to finish.
- The approval floor is now violated by any *overlap*: granting `deployment.create` for every
  environment no longer slips past a floor on `deployment.create:production`.
- A task may name the base protocol its profile refines (`aep/1` with a profile written against
  `adp/1`), which is the form the design documents use.

### Changed

- Evidence files spell the envelope's subject `about`, not `subject`, so it cannot silently consume a
  payload's own `subject` — a review's subject is the artifact reviewed.
- `protocol evaluate` exits `0` whenever it produced a report. A blocked execution is an answer, not
  a failure; `explain --action` still exits `1` when an action is refused.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-08-19

### Added

- **`aep-domain`** — the source-of-truth model: identifiers and versioned references, a three-valued
  predicate language, facts and ordered scales, capabilities with default-deny, actions, evidence with
  provenance, verifiers and counterexamples, the artifact graph with lifecycles and typed relations,
  review semantics with revision-bound approval, requirements over evidence/artifacts/reviews/
  approvals/conditions, principles with phase-timed obligations, workflows, tasks, protocols,
  profiles, execution plans and the audit event vocabulary.
- **`aep-schema`** — document reading that separates syntax from semantic failure, and JSON Schema
  generation for six document types and four interchange types.
- **`xtask schema [--check]`** — schemas are generated from the Rust types, and CI proves they match.
- Repository scaffolding: workspace, `Taskfile.yml` gate, Apache-2.0 licence, `AGENTS.md`.
